## General guidelines

Study and follow the adopted [Data Culture style guide](https://github.com/datacult/AE-coding-conventions/blob/main/dc-sql_style.md)


Leverage the official dbt best [practices](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/legacy/best-practices).


## Project structure

The desire to have a project layout is to help with the decision making process and build a standard across projects.<br>This allows for ease in setting up projects and can reduce decision fatigue.
In other to allow easy of navigating around the project, it's important the project structure reflect how the data flows, step-by-step, from a wide variety of source-conformed models into fewer, richer business-conformed models.

To that effect, Models should be organized into folders corresponding to their purpose.

For each dbt project, there should be four layers:

* **Sources** :
  * This is the initial entry point for models, as they are bought in from external sources via a data loader (Fivetran)
  * Each source should have their own folder, which corresponds to the schema they are being imported from
    * E.g. Data from `google_analytics` and `shopify` will have a subdirectories `google_analytics` and `shopify` respectively under the **sources** directory

A `<source_name>.yml` file defining the dbt sources should exist within each source-specific directory. That is `google_analytics.yml` and `shopify.yml`.

#### dos and don'ts with naming the Sources directory
[x] Naming the subdirectories based on the source system is best practice. That is, naming the subdirectories from where they come from is helpful as they tend to share similar loading methods and properties between tables and can be operated on similarly. So data from the internal transactional database can be a system, data from Shopify in another model, etc.

[x] It is **NOT** recommended to name subdirectories based on loaders as this can be too broad. So all things loaded with Fivetran from multiple sources should not all be in one subdirectory.

[x] It is also **NOT** recommended to create subdirectories based on business groupings like “marketing”, “finance” and so on. This is because we want to create single sources of truth and overlapping and conflicting definitions can be hidden by this method.


* **Staging Layer**
This is the layer that is connected to the source and low-level transformations are performed here. This is where the modular building blocks of our transformation layer live. <br>This is where we are refining the blocks that will later be built into more intricate and useful structures
Each model in this layer bears a one-to-one relationship with the source data table it represents. It has the same granularity. <br> Transformation that occur in this layer include: 
    * Renaming
    * Type Casting
    * Basic computations/Conversions
    * Categorizing (Case when statements)
    
    Transformation that we DON’T do in this layer are;
    * Joins
    * Aggregations

The base layer directory may be introduced when two sources must be **joined** to create a usable staging model.

```
        source -----> base -----╷
                                |---> staging -----> intermediate -----╷
        source -----> base------╵                                      |----> mart
                                                                       |
        source ---------------------> staging -----> intermediate -----╵
```
When it comes with naming files & models in directories, consistency is key. The file names must be unique and correspond to the name of the model when selected and created in the warehouse. As a result, as much clear information should be in the file name. 
This includes the prefix for which layer the model exists in, important grouping information and whatever specific information about the entity or transformation in the model.

A good example of naming format for the files would be base_[source]__[entity]s.sql:

The double underscore between source system and the entity is to visually distinguish the separate parts in the case of a source name having multiple words. 
This adds clarity to google_analytics__campaigns and makes it easier to read than google_analytics_campaigns. The former lets us know that the source is google_analytics that has a campaigns entity while the latter can be read as the same or as a source called google with an analytics_campaign entity.

[x] Files should **NOT** be named without specifying the source. This form of naming fuels will break down over time plus you lose the advantage of being able to figure out where the model is from without using the DAG.
	In naming the models, it should read as well as possible and that means, it is fine and even expected to use plurals. So **orders** table reads better than *order* table.

Models in this layer are either materialized as `views` or `ephemeral` since they are not final artifacts are are building blocks for later models.
Models in this layer should have a 1:1 relationship to the sources and are the only place where the [source](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources) macro should be used.

Other Considerations can be found [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging#staging-other-considerations).

* **Logic Layer**

This is the layer where most of the transformation takes place. This is where we bring together the blocks in the base layer. 
These models are built with specific purposes on the way to the final data products

When it comes to naming files, it is important to use the `logic_[entity]s_[verb]s`.sql format.
The best guiding principle is to think about verbs (e.g. *pivoted*, *aggregated_to_user*, *joined*, *fanned_out_by_quanity*, *funnel_created*, etc.) 
in the intermediate layer. In our example project, we use an intermediate model to pivot payments out to the order grain, so we name our model *logic_payments_pivoted_to_orders*. It’s easy for anybody to quickly understand what’s happening in that model, even if they don’t know SQL. 
That clarity is worth the long file name. It’s important to note that we’ve dropped the double underscores at this layer.
In moving towards business conformed concepts, we no longer need to separate a system and an entity and simply reference the unified entity if possible. 
In cases where you need intermediate models to operate at the source system level (e.g. int_shopify__orders_summed, int_core__orders_summed which you would later union), you’d preserve the double underscores 

In this layer, it is important to ensure that any CTEs used are named to provide clarity to anyone reading the code. An example would be pivot_and_aggregate_payments_to_order_grain as it gives a clear idea of what happens within the CTE.

#### dos and don'ts
[x] This layer is NOT exposed to end users.
[x] The models can either be materialized as a view in a custom schema or ephemerally.
[x] To simplify structure, rather than have 10 joins in the mart, we can have most of the joins done here. That way, we can have maximum of 4 joins in the mart.
[x] It is highly recommended to move complex bits to their own models. This includes fan outs or collapsing of models.
[x] If a particular model is being used across multiple models, it should be made a macro instead of remaining a model. This is to keep things DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

* **Marts**
They are stores of models that describe business entities and processes. They are often grouped by business unit: marketing, finance, product. Models that are shared across an entire business are grouped in a core directory.

Models in this layer are materialized as **tables** and when they take too long to query, when that takes too long, we configure as [incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/configuring-incremental-models). We only add complexity when necessary.
* We are to build wide and denormalised tables as the final output as much as possible.
* Unless simple joins, joins in a model here should NOT be more than 3. This is because we are not going for complexity in this layer. Any complexity should be moved to the logic layer.

Other considerations can be found [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts#marts-other-considerations).

## Environment and Schema Organization

### Environment

Create two(2) Databases for project setup; 
* **transform/staging** : Database to host all development workflows, materialized tables and views to be validated & QAed before pushing to production.  <br> For easy data retrieval and it can organized into different **schemas** based on dbt project layout as follows:
    * Staging : All other models that need to be validated and QAed by users before pushing to production
    * Marts : Only for Facts, Dimensions and aggregated reporting table to be exposed to BI layers.
    * Intermediate/Logic :- Business Logic and source data transformations that won't be queried by downstream users for reporting purposes.
    * Tests (Optional) 
 
* **analytics** : This database will contain production ready (cleaned, on a schedule, query-ready) dimension and fact tables. <br> For easy data retrieval and it can organized into different **schemas** based on dbt project layout as follows:
    * Same as above in **transform/staging** db
    * Snapshots (Optional) : If SCD need to be captured

### Schema

#### [Check out dbt officials docs on the behavior of default schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas)

- In production and development database environment, appropriate custom schemas should be utilized to define which schemas each model or view should be materialized in.

Use the `generate_schema_name` macro below to dynamically determine where to materialize the models:

```sql
{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}

    {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}

    {%- if target.name == 'dev' or target.name=='default' -%}
        {{ target.schema }}{{ '_' ~ custom_schema_name if custom_schema_name else '' }}

    {%- elif target.name == 'prod' -%}
        {{ custom_schema_name if custom_schema_name else target.schema }}

    {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}

```
*The custom `generate_schema_name` macro can be customized to fit purpose*
