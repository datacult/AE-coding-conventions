##### Code Checklist (Put an `x` in all the items that apply, make notes next to any that haven't been addressed, and remove items that are not relevant to this PR)

- [ ]  My request represents one logical piece of work and is at most ~250 lines of code
- [ ]  My commits are related to the pull request
- [ ]  My SQL follows the [Data Culture style guide](https://github.com/datacult/AE-coding-conventions/blob/main/dc-sql_style.md)
- [ ]  I have materialized my models appropriately
- [ ]  I have added appropriate tests and documentation to new models

##### The following checklist is for RedShift Warehouses
- [ ] I have updated the README file
- [ ] I have added sort and dist keys to models materialized as tables
- [ ] I have validated the SQL in any late-binding views

- [ ]  Any additional callouts you may have for specific code you need reviewed (ex: incurring tech debt, special logic for edge-case handling, special business logic, etc)

# Data Culture Pull Request Review Checklist

- [ ]  Data Culture Pull Request Review Checklist
- [ ]  Feedback to the code provides a suggested solution
    - [ ]  Leave actionable / explicit / complete comments 
    - [ ]  Share references when requesting changes where appropriate
    - [ ]  Combine similar comments
    - [ ]  Replace “you” with “we”
- [ ]  Follow Commenting Format:   <color code><label> [decorations]: <subject> 
                                [discussion]



#### Considerations When Reviewing 
- [ ]  Design: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for your system?
- [ ]  Functionality: Does the code behave as the author intended?
    - [ ]  Provide a description of how you believe / are reading the code to function
    - [ ]  Data returns expected results
    - [ ]  Materializations are designated appropriately
- [ ]  Complexity: Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the future?
    - [ ]  Is there repeat code
    - [ ]  Can the DAG be modified so fields can be defined earlier and cascaded more seamlessly
    - [ ]  Should parts of the code use macros or dbt-utils
    - [ ]  Can CTEs be models of their own
    - [ ]  Would this code be easily scaled
- [ ]  Tests: Does the code have correct and well-designed functional tests?
    - [ ]  Uniqueness and not null at a minimum
- [ ]  Naming: Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes, methods, etc.?
    - [ ]  Do model names appropriately represent the grain of the model?
    - [ ]  Do the new or changed model names follow the conventions of the project? For example, we have specific internal conventions around model prefixes such as stg_, fct_, and dim_.
    - [ ]  Are fields in models straightforward / descriptive and to the point 
- [ ]  Comments: Are the comments clear and useful?
- [ ]  Style: Does the code follow our Data Culture style guides?
- [ ]  Documentation: Did the developer also update relevant documentation?
